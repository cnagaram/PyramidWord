PYRAMID WORD

A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if the letters can be arranged in increasing frequency, starting with 1 
and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.

Examples:
banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
abbeeedddd is a pyramid word because you have 1 'a', 2 'b's, 3 'e's, and 4 'd's.

bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
